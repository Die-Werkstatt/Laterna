# Laterna

What Laterna is, its stack, structure and rules: see `../CLAUDE.md`. This file holds
the conventions shared with other AllesSandro projects.

## Build & dev commands

```sh
python3 .claude/suite-check.py   # every health check in .claude/suite.json
```

## Task tracking
Work is tracked in GitHub Issues. Every issue carries a `type:`, an `area:` and
exactly one priority (`p0`-`p3`) label. The issue forms ask for it and the
`issue-priority` workflow applies it; an issue opened through the API (by an
agent) sets the label in the same call, `p2` when unclear. Close issues from
the pull request with `Fixes #N`.

## Commits & pull requests

- One pull request per piece of work, never one per tweak. Its `## Changelog`
  section gives each change a line (`- feature: ...`, `- fix: ...`,
  `- chore: ...`). Split only for risk, an independent revert or a different
  release.
- Changelog lines and titles are public release-notes copy: imperative,
  sentence case, no trailing period, no em dashes.
- Every pull request needs an `area:` label, plus a `type:` label when it has
  no Changelog section, before it can merge (the `pr-labelled` status). Which
  type: see `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

## Files that come from the template

This repo was created from sandrogekeler/AllesSandro and is kept in step with it
by Renovate (`.copier-answers.yml` records the version). Two kinds of file:

- **Locked** (re-applied on every template update): `.claude/suite-*.py`,
  `.github/workflows/{codeql,scorecard,pr-labelled,labels,template-guard,issue-priority}.yml`
  (CodeQL and Scorecard only on a public repo) and the optional `aislop.yml`,
  `claude.yml`, `.aislop/base.yml`, `.github/scripts/changelog-section.py`,
  `.github/scripts/release-notes.py`,
  `.claude/rules/{writing,simplicity,typography}.md`. Do not edit them here: change
  AllesSandro instead. A local edit is kept but shows up as a merge conflict on
  the next template update.
- **Seeded** (created once, owned by this repo): everything else, including
  this file.

A template-update PR with `<<<<<<< before updating` markers: see
`.claude/rules/template-files.md`.

## Docs

Describe what is on disk, in the present tense. Intent goes in
`agent_docs/ROADMAP.md` as an unchecked item. Unsure whether something landed?
Check before writing it down.

## Do not

- Commit secrets, `.env` files or credentials.
- Edit generated files or lockfiles by hand; regenerate them.

## Deeper rules, loaded on demand

`.claude/rules/*.md`: each one names the paths that load it.
